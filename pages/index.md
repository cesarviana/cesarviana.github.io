# **About Me**

{% include landing.html %}

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I’ve a Computer Science degree, and working experience with VueJS, PHP, Java and JavaScript. My life goal is to build applications to produce good impact in the world. I enjoy working in democratic teams, where developers can share their creativity and they are free to build. I like clean code, and think that to be clean, we must refactor early and often.

Here are some websites and pages I’ve developed or contributed to:

- [Eletroblocks](https://eletroblocks.com.br)
- [Lab publications page](https://lite.acad.univali.br/publicacoes-2)
- [TVGaspar](https://tvgaspar.com.br)

Actually finishing master's in Applied Computing. Here are my work on that.

- [Designing Programmable Toy’s Interfaces for Small Children](https://estudosemdesign.emnuvens.com.br/design/article/view/1150/466)
- [Dissertation repository](https://github.com/cesarviana/dissertation)
